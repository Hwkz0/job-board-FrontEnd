# Job Board Frontend

An interface for a job board. Currently under development. It s meant to be used with the job board api I also created ( link to repoository : https://github.com/Hwkz0/Job-Board-BackEnd )
I'm using react, axios, bootstrap, react-router-dom and I will probably add more until end of development.
